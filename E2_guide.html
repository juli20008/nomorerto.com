                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">The E-2 visa allows entrepreneurs from treaty countries to invest in and actively manage a U.S. business. Unlike purely passive investments, this visa is designed to encourage genuine commercial activity and job creation. The rules are grounded in U.S. treaties with other nations and covered in the Foreign Affairs Manual.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">If approved, an E-2 visa can be renewed indefinitely as long as the enterprise continues to operate and meet the requirements. Spouses can work, children can study, and the investor has the flexibility to build and grow their business in the United States.</p>

                            <li><strong>No set minimum:</strong> Your investment must be “substantial,” judged against the cost of the business and the proportionality test.</li>
                            <li><strong>Investment must be at risk:</strong> Unsecured loans or loans secured by your personal assets count. Loans secured only by business assets do not.</li>
                            <li><strong>Business must be real & operating:</strong> Paper companies and passive investments don’t qualify.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enterprise cannot be marginal:</strong> It must have the present or future capacity to create jobs or significant economic impact.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ownership & control:</strong> Treaty nationals must own at least 50% of the business or otherwise control it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intent to depart:</strong> You must confirm that you plan to leave the U.S. when your E-2 status ends. A short signed statement is usually sufficient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Family benefits:</strong> Spouses can work with automatic authorization, and children under 21 can live and study in the U.S.</li>

                    <h2>Requirements Checklist</h2>
                    <p>To qualify for the E-2 visa, you must meet the following baseline requirements:</p>
                    <ul class="space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Treaty nationality:</strong> At least 50% of the business must be owned by nationals of a treaty country.</li>
                        <li><strong>Substantial investment:</strong> The investment must be large enough to ensure the success of the enterprise and pass the proportionality test.</li>
                        <li><strong>At-risk funds:</strong> Capital must be committed and subject to loss. Unsecured personal loans or loans secured by personal assets qualify; loans secured only by business assets do not.</li>
                        <li><strong>Real and operating business:</strong> The enterprise must be active and producing goods or services—not a shell or speculative holding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Not marginal:</strong> The business must support more than just the investor and family—it should have the capacity to employ U.S. workers or make a meaningful economic contribution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Investor control:</strong> You must develop and direct the business, usually shown by at least 50% ownership or operational control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intent to depart:</strong> You must show you will leave the U.S. once your E-2 status ends, though no foreign residence is required.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section id="treaty">
                    <h2>Treaty & Nationality</h2>
                    <p>To qualify for the E-2 visa, there must be a qualifying treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and the investor’s country of nationality. In addition, the U.S. enterprise must be at least 50% owned and controlled by nationals of that treaty country. This is a fundamental requirement that underpins the entire visa classification.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What Counts as a Treaty Country?</h3>
                    <p>The United States maintains treaties of commerce and navigation with many countries worldwide. Only nationals of these countries can qualify for an E-2 visa. It is important to check the current list of treaty countries on the State Department website, as this list can change.</p>

                    <h3>Determining the Enterprise’s Nationality</h3>
                    <p>The nationality of the business is determined by the nationality of its owners. If at least 50% of the business is owned by nationals of a single treaty country, the enterprise can qualify. Ownership can be through individuals or through entities, but in layered structures, adjudicators will look through to the natural persons who ultimately own the shares.</p>
                    <p class="bg-slate-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-gold-500 italic">For example, if a U.S. LLC is owned 60% by a Canadian national and 40% by a British national, the company has Canadian nationality for E-2 purposes. But if the ownership is split evenly (50/50) between two different treaty countries, the company generally cannot qualify, since no single treaty nationality has majority ownership.</p>

                    <h3>Special Considerations</h3>
                    <ul class="space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Dual Nationals:</strong> Applicants who hold more than one nationality must choose which passport and nationality to use. Only the qualifying treaty nationality counts for E-2 purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lawful Permanent Residents (Green Card Holders):</strong> Even if someone is a permanent resident of the U.S., their shares do not count toward the 50% treaty nationality requirement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Corporate Chains:</strong> If a company is owned by another company, officers will look at the nationality of the individuals who ultimately own the parent company shares.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Evidence to Prepare</h3>
                    <ul class="space-y-1">
                        <li>Passports of all owners showing treaty nationality.</li>
                        <li>Corporate documents such as articles of incorporation, bylaws, and operating agreements.</li>
                        <li>Ownership charts or cap tables showing percentage breakdowns.</li>
                        <li>Stock certificates and share ledgers.</li>
                        <li>Board resolutions or shareholder agreements that demonstrate control.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section id="investment">
                    <h2>Substantial Investment & Proportionality</h2>
                    <p>One of the most common questions in the E-2 process is: “How much do I need to invest?” The law does not set a fixed dollar threshold. Instead, the investment must be substantial in relation to the type of business, judged by what is known as the proportionality test. This test comes directly from the Foreign Affairs Manual (9 FAM 402.9).</p>

                    <h3>The Proportionality Test</h3>
                    <p>Adjudicators compare two numbers:</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4 space-y-1 text-slate-700">
                        <li>The amount you have already invested or irrevocably committed to the U.S. enterprise, and</li>
                        <li>The total cost of purchasing or creating the type of business you are pursuing.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The closer your investment is to 100% of the required start-up costs, the stronger the case. For low-cost businesses, nearly all of the needed capital should be committed before applying. For high-cost businesses, a smaller percentage may be acceptable if the dollar figure is still significant.</p>

                    <h3>Examples</h3>
                    <ul class="space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Small café:</strong> If a coffee shop requires $120,000 to start, and you have already invested $110,000, you’ve committed over 90% of the necessary funds. This would likely be considered substantial.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tech manufacturing facility:</strong> If a specialized plant requires $5 million in equipment and buildout, a $1.5 million investment may qualify. While only 30% of the total, it’s still a very significant sum in absolute terms.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Funds Must Be Irrevocably Committed</h3>
                    <p>It is not enough to show that you have the funds—you must show they are at risk and committed to the business. This means:</p>
                    <ul class="space-y-1">
                        <li>Payments already made for fees, equipment, buildout, inventory, etc.</li>
                        <li>Lease agreements signed and deposits paid.</li>
                        <li>Contracts with vendors or franchise agreements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section id="at-risk">
                    <h2>At-Risk Funds & Loans</h2>
                    <p>To qualify for an E-2 visa, your investment funds must be placed at risk of partial or total loss if the business fails. This ensures that the investor is truly committed to the success of the enterprise. Simply holding money in a bank account, or promising to invest later, does not satisfy this requirement.</p>

                    <h3>Loans and Financing</h3>
                    <p>Loans can be part of your investment, but not all loans qualify. The key issue is who bears the risk if the business fails.</p>
                    <ul class="space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Unsecured loans:</strong> Count as investment funds, since the investor is personally liable if the business fails.</li>
                        <li><strong>Loans secured by personal assets:</strong> (e.g., a mortgage on your home) Count, since you personally stand to lose assets unrelated to the E-2 business.</li>
                        <li><strong>Loans secured by the E-2 business's assets:</strong> (e.g., the business’s own equipment or inventory) Do not count, since the risk falls on the lender, not the investor.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Escrow Arrangements</h3>
                    <p>Placing funds in escrow can qualify as at risk if the release of funds is tied to visa approval. For example, if you are purchasing a franchise or an existing business, you may deposit the franchise fee or purchase funds into an escrow account that is controlled by a third party escrow agent. If your E-2 visa is approved, the funds are released to the seller; if not, the funds are returned. This shows intent to commit funds while protecting the investor from unnecessary loss.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="real-operating">
                    <h2>Real & Operating Business</h2>
                    <p>An E-2 enterprise must be real and operating. In other words, it must be a genuine commercial undertaking that actively produces goods or services for profit. The Foreign Affairs Manual stresses that paper companies, idle speculative ventures, or shell entities do not qualify.</p>

                    <h3>What Counts as Operating?</h3>
                    <p>An operating business is one that is active or imminently ready to operate. The standard is practical: the company should be doing business or demonstrating clear readiness to begin. Examples include:</p>
                    <ul class="space-y-1">
                        <li>Signed lease agreements and site buildouts underway.</li>
                        <li>Vendor or supplier contracts.</li>
                        <li>Employees hired or payroll set up.</li>
                        <li>Active marketing campaigns and customer inquiries.</li>
                        <li>Inventory purchased and delivered.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Startups:</strong> Startups must show they are more than just a plan. Evidence of active steps, like equipment purchases and initial operations, is critical.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="marginality">
                    <h2>More Than Marginal (5-Year Outlook)</h2>
                    <p>To qualify for an E-2 visa, the business cannot be marginal. In practice, this means the enterprise must have the present or future capacity, within five years, to generate enough income to provide more than a minimal living for the investor and their family.</p>

                    <h3>How Officers Evaluate Marginality</h3>
                    <ul class="space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Revenue trajectory:</strong> Does the financial plan show meaningful revenue growth over five years?</li>

                    <h2>Develop & Direct the Enterprise</h2>
                    <p>Beyond investing and owning, the treaty investor must be coming to the United States to develop and direct the enterprise. This means the investor plays an active role in guiding the company’s growth and day-to-day or strategic operations, rather than serving as a passive investor.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Evidence That Helps</h3>
                    <ul class="space-y-1">
                        <li>Corporate documents naming the investor as an officer, director, or manager.</li>
                        <li>Resumes or biographies showing relevant managerial or entrepreneurial experience.</li>
                        <li>Employment agreements outlining executive duties.</li>
                        <li>Organizational charts highlighting the investor’s leadership role.</li>

                    <h2>Source & Path of Funds</h2>
                    <p>For an E-2 visa, the investor must show that the invested capital comes from a lawful source and that there is a clear, documented path of funds from origin to the U.S. enterprise. The goal is to ensure the investment is legitimate, transparent, and fully attributable to the investor.</p>

                    <h3>Lawful Sources of Funds</h3>
                    <ul class="space-y-1">
                        <li>Personal savings (documented with bank statements and tax returns).</li>
                        <li>Income from employment or business profits.</li>
                        <li>Inheritance or gifts (with supporting wills, gift letters, and transfer records).</li>
                        <li>Sale of property or other assets (with sale contracts and payment receipts).</li>
                        <li>Loans — unsecured loans or loans secured by personal assets qualify.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Tracing the Path of Funds</h3>
                    <p>The investor must clearly trace the flow of funds from the source into the U.S. business. This often means showing each step through financial records. For example:</p>
                    <p class="font-mono text-sm bg-slate-100 p-3 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">Original source &rarr; Personal bank account &rarr; U.S. business account &rarr; Business expenses</p>

                    <h2>Intent to Depart the U.S.</h2>
                    <p>E-2 status is temporary. Even though it can be renewed indefinitely, every applicant must demonstrate that they intend to depart the United States once their E-2 status eventually ends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Signed Statement:</strong> In most cases, a simple signed declaration stating that you intend to depart the U.S. when your E-2 status concludes is sufficient.</p>
                    <p><strong>What You Don’t Need:</strong> You do not need to maintain a residence abroad or prove that you will never apply for a green card.</p>
